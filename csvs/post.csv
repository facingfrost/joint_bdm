You can visit diferents incredibles places. Is located in the montain so the weather is cooler. You take the L3 of the subway and stop at the Mundet station and them cruise the Can de Marcet Avenue. I really like this place.",5,Agora BCN,accommodation
2013-02-28,"Very simply furnished room (no TV, fridge or anything), however nice and clean- who does need more? Excellent breakfast (earlier you get to the restaurant the more variety of food you have to chose from) Only issue is that the complex is located outside city center (20-25 min by metro) and can be little tricky to find at the first time. PRICE/VALUE RATIO is unbeatable. All we needed was a nice, clean, safe place with breakfast. We have been spending whole day in the city so distance was not a problem either.",4,Agora BCN,accommodation

Swimming pool is much smaller than expected, deep only 1m; also the room is not very big but the balcony (as big as the bedroom) with two deckchairs makes up for that. Brekfast a bit expensive but worth it, cheeper if booked for every day. Nice experience but often too noisy because of other turists",4,Catalonia Park Güell,accommodation
2013-09-20,"I had a lovely visit at Amiga Barcelona. Margarita, Carlos and all of the staff were beyond expectations - warm, caring and attentive. The breakfast was superb!!!

This one was by far the best.",5,Bed and Breakfast Amiga Barcelona,accommodation
2011-06-20,"LOVED IT!! LOVED IT!! LOVED IT!! Felt like at home. Margarita welcomed us with a cold beer, then sat down with us to talk about places to go see and restaurants to go eat. The room was really clean and the bed was very comfortable. It&#39;s conveniently located (about 5 min walk from the metro station station and 10 min walk to Parc Guell) and in about 15-20 minutes we were in the Barri Gotic in the heart of Barcelona.

2012-03-07,"Margarita&#39;s place is the most lovely hotel I ever stayed at in Barcelona, it was such a pleasure to visit! I have never had such wundervoll, rich and great breakfast and enjoyed the calm and piece and warmth of the art deco house and the streets on the old hill. The place is close to the metro and has the great advantage to be calm and with a very good, personal atmosphere. The price is extremely generous for the location and the experience of this beautiful house.",5,Bed and Breakfast Amiga Barcelona,accommodation
2008-03-03,"What a fantastic find! Great value and wonderfully situated for the city centre and the main attractions. The owner, Margarita, makes you feel right at home immediately and the breakfast spread in the beautiful dining room is unmissable!

When I arrived, one of the staff checked me in, gave me a map and pointed all the places I should go visit the next day, which I did. The breakfast was basic, bread with jam/butter, coffee/tea/hot chocolate, orange juice. They do have a fridge to store your own food and a microwave. The location is in a neighborhood away from downtown Barcelona, but there is a bus stop and subway station nearby, within a few minutes walk. Worth the stay.",5,Albergue Studio Hostel,accommodation
2013-04-16,"Nice hostel! Rooms are clean, tidy and cozy, cleaned frequently. Breakfast are simple...even though they are the same everyday..they are filling...and nice...tea or coffee or cocoa with milk..and bread..with diff types of bread-spread for u to choose from. There is a fridge and 3 types of oven in the kitchen. The hostel is 3 storied...i think...but never had bathroom shortage problem...there are 2 or mayb 3 common bathrooms with toilet... Sara is so friendly and nice! She speaks english fluently...helped alot with places to go...and advices for trips... The hostel is abit far from city centre...but the metro station is very near to the hostel...around 5 min away...metro took around 30 minutes to reach central metro station for switching trains...early departure from hostel and starting your day early would cause no problem to your schedule at all... There is washing machine and dryer and iron and lockers... Overall this is an excellent hostel!

The WiFi worked, but it was of course quite slow (probably limited to 0.5/0.5 Mbps) and you had to ask for a new user account every 4 days, still better than nothing.

The hostel is very well organised, provides you with laundry machine, refrigerator, fully equipped kitchen and a couple more things. Staff is very friendly and helpful, rooms are clean and spacious enough. Unfortunately, the hostel doesn&#39;t have the best place - there is no problem living a bit far from the city centre, as the metro station is not far away, but it seems to be the highest point in town. It becomes a serious problem when carrying a large backpack. This hardship, however, is compensated by very cheerful and helpful service who aids you as soon as you enter the hostel. Otherwise great and I really recommend it.",4,Feetup Mellow Eco Hostel Barcelona,accommodation

Across the street is a dance club, down the street is a small playground for children. A good slice of life. Balmes, Gracia and Diagonal streets are close-by w/ restaurants and shops.

I recommend that you take the breakfast pack because you&#39;ll end up much cheaper than just paying there for it. The hotel is close to whatever you want to visit. Just take the subway and you are there. It&#39;s close to the Avenida Diagonal street and from there you can visit La Pedrera and other sites. Breakfast is diverse and delicious. Oh! Not to forget about the staff. They are very helpful. Whatever information you might need just ask and they will help. They also have tickets at the hotel for the main attractions. so if you by from the hotel you don&#39;t have to wait in line for buying one. We thought it&#39;s not necessary when we went to teh Sagrada Famillia and we ended up staying about 15 minutes on the line. I thought Barcelona would be more spectacular, but it wasn&#39;t. So I would come back to Barcelona only to see what I&#39;ve missed and I would defenely stay at Aparthotel Mariano Cubi. It&#39;s in the city center, but on a quite street.

2013-07-23,Excellent hotel with rooms clean and of adequate size. Use of computer in foyer a bonus and all staff friendly and helpful. Only criticism is the breakfast is very over priced. Bar on opposite corner particularly good value. Found taxis when ordered through hotel more expensive than when &quot;flagged down&quot; nearby.

It had a great balcony overlooking the street which was a bit noisy, but at the same time desirable in the way that it allowed us to look out onto the neighborhood, open up the room to some sunlight and enjoy the crisp Barcelona air. The train station was very convenient and located about a block away. We walked from our hostel to Parc de Guell, then onto La Segrada and even took a stroll down to the beach. It&#39;s a straight shot down Gran de Gracia and it&#39;s nearly impossible to get lost if you don&#39;t know your way around like we didn&#39;t. The staff were very friendly and I was even able to pay a little extra for wifi internet which was key for accessing email from my laptop. The room was clean (not white gloves clean, but clean enough for me and this coming from someone who vaccums their house 3 times a week!). The shared bathroom and shower were always clean and private. I&#39;m not one to like to share bathrooms and was very surprised how &#39;ok&#39; I was with it.

2013-08-04,"This is by far one the best hotels we have ever stayed in. The service was exceptional. Every question we had they patiently helped us with. When we wanted tickets printed for various things we were going to do, they would print it for us and deliver to our room. The location is also a bonus since it is central to many things like La Padrera, Nou Camp (if there is a game on, it is a must to watch it), Sagrada Familia, La Ramblas and so on. There are buses that go to all of these places for 2 euro per person one way and are very easy to look up on Google. We got around for 5 days without getting lost and only taking a cab twice. There is a little bit of noise from the street, but should not bother people at all. For breakfast we would walk down to the pans and company, about 2 blocks away, every morning for a very delicious meal and coffee and its a fair price. The gym actually has proper equipment and the rooftop pools are nice in summer. We could not have asked for more here and really hope others will stay here.",5,Hotel Condes de Barcelona,accommodation

The shower was a bit small but clean. You have everything you need for a comfortable stay. The location of the B&amp;B is amazing, close to the city&#39;s centre (Placa de catalunya, Ramblas, harbour etc.), the subway &amp; several buslines are only a couple of minutes walking away. On top of all this I was very lucky because I stayed there during the Gracia-festival which is always in the 3rd week of August.

The location was also good, we were in walking distance of the Sagrada Familia (10 min) and Park Guell (15-20 min) and several metro stations. We even walked to Pg de Gracia and La Rambla (30-40 min) and Torre Agbar. The streets are laid out in grids so it&#39;s easy to navigate and the B&amp;B offers several maps you can borrow.

2010-05-11,"I enjoyed my stay since the moment I arrived at Hispano Siete Suiza Hotel in April 2010: the way I was received, the excellent family room, the greatly prepared staff able to answer all my questions. Besides that, the hotel is very well located, close to the amazing Sagrada Familia, to the public transportation, charming bakeries, cafes, fruit stores, and restaurants. There&#39;s something I will never forget abou my stay: at the airport, due to the aerial chaos, I was told I couldn&#39;t fly to Paris with my family as I had planned and then called to the hotel to check if we could return. They said they had no availability anymore but made arrangements for us to stay in a partner hotel. Among so much stress and disappointment with the unpredictible situation their help was fundamental; at that point finding a hotel in Barcelona seemed impossible. I am so thankful for all they did for me and my family. I strongly recommend this hotel and also their parter, Wilson Hotel, at Diagonal Ave.",5,Hispanos 7 Suiza Apartament-Restaurant,accommodation

The rooms a clean, the people friendly, and the location is also great. Both of the guest houses are in private apartment buildings about a 20 minute walk away from the main tourist traps like La Ramba, with La Sagrada Familia and the Metro very close by. If you are looking for a solid breakfast or a private bathroom, this is not the place for you.

2009-06-03,"Just got back from a trip to Barcelona in late May 2009. Stayed in a double room at the Praktik 3 nights. This is a great hotel, especially when you compare prices in the rest of Barcelona. The rooms are clean and modern (with excellent showers), but with some nice older touches (wooden window shutters, tile floors). Location was great - about a 10-15 minute walk to the top of the Ramblas, Girona Metro stop 1.5 blocks away. Neighborhood felt safe, even late at night, and the hotel seemed extremely secure. The staff was extremely courteous and helpful, providing recommendations, directions, etc. They are also excellent English-speakers. 1 computer with free internet access and a nice little 2nd-floor sunning deck were nice touches as well. A word of warning to anyone visiting Barcelona - wear a money belt. I was pick-pocketed in the Verdaguer Metro station on my way from the Sants train station to the hotel, probably 10 minutes in to my visit.
